# algorithmsFinal

Algorithms final project my freshman year, trying to implement a dictionary in 4 ways to see which is most efficient, conclusion: the b-tree and trie were very competitive, however the b-tree was the fastest which was the metric I was looking for, although the trie uses much less space
